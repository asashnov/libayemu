  This is the AY/YM sound chip emulator. These chips was used in such
computers as Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128Kb(AY8912), Atari and some others.

  This library allow to use AY/YM sound effects and music in your own
programms, games, demos, etc. User must pass to library array of AY/YM
registers (14-bytes) and library will generate sound stream by this.
Library have functions for handle .vtx files (see below), doxygen
format documentation and samples of use the library API.

  VTX format is made for store AY/YM song in lha5 complession. This
library can read sond info header and unpack lha5 compressed data from

$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@libayemu.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/libayemu login 
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@libayemu.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/libayemu co -P libayemu
$ cd libayemu
$ cvs2cl
$ sh bootstrap

Now you can build from scratch:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

Or Debian package:
$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc

Or RPM package:
$ ???
